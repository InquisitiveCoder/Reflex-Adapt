# Reflex Adapt

## MiSTer

Install the Adapt firmware updater on MiSTer by downloading [reflex_updater.sh](https://github.com/misteraddons/Reflex-Adapt/releases/latest/download/reflex_updater.sh) and copying it to the `Scripts` folder on your SD card.

Alternatively, add the following to your `downloader.ini` file to install and auto-update through Downloader and Update All:

```
[misteraddons/reflexadapt]
db_url = https://github.com/misteraddons/Reflex-Adapt/releases/latest/download/reflexadapt.json
```

The `reflex_updater.sh` script can then be launched from the Scripts menu.
